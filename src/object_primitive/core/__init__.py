"""
Core primitives of the Object Primitive System.

This module contains the fundamental building blocks:
- ObjectPrimitive: The core object that unifies code, data, and execution
- EndpointLoader: Loads and manages endpoint code
- VersionManager: Handles automatic versioning and rollback
- ObjectModel: The data model for objects

These primitives must be rock solid. They are tested extensively.
Everything else builds on these foundations.

Philosophy:
    The core is the stable invariant. It never changes.
    Everything else can be swapped, updated, or replaced.
