"""
Utility functions for the Object Primitive System.

This module contains helper functions used throughout the system:
- Logging (structured logging)
- Validation (input validation)
- Serialization (JSON, TSV, etc.)
- Hashing (content addressing)
- Time handling (UTC, ISO 8601)
- Path handling (safe path operations)

Philosophy:
    Utils are the boring but essential glue code.
    They should be well-tested, simple, and reliable.

    No clever code here - just solid utilities.
